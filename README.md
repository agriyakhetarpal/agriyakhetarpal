### Agriya Khetarpal

_Full-time Pythonista, part-time poet, and hopeful code poet_ üêç

Hi there! I am a senior undergrad at the University of Delhi in New Delhi, India; pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree in Information Technology and Mathematical Innovations with a minor in Management.

Here is a list of what I am interested in and would continually like to learn more about ‚Äì which is by no means exhaustive:

- open-source software in scientific computing,
- the study of numerical methods and their applications in the physical sciences,
- cloud computing and infrastructure at scale,
- interfacing compiled and interpreted languages together,
- DevOps and site reliability engineering (SRE), and
- best practices in software engineering and testing automation.

I currently volunteer and help maintain [PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling)](https://pybamm.org), a Python package and library for the mathematical modelling of batteries and for conducting efficient simulations and experiments (and some of its surrounding packages).

You can usually find me lurking around on myriads of repositories and discussions related to Python packaging and developer tooling, its scientific computing ecosystem, build systems, and more ‚Äì occasionally contributing to them as well.

For the ones that seek poetic malaise, here's a quote from _Ode: Intimations of Immortality_ by William Wordsworth:


**‚ÄúWhither is fled the visionary gleam? Where is it now, the glory and the dream?‚Äù**
