### Agriya Khetarpal

_Full-time Pythonista, part-time poet, and hopeful code poet_ üêç

Hi there! I am a recent graduate of the University of Delhi in New Delhi, India, where I majored in computer science and mathematics. I work at Quansight Labs as a software engineer, where my work comprises the packaging and distribution of open-source scientific software.

I currently volunteer and help maintain the following projects ‚Äì a list which is by no means exhaustive:

- [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/), a port of CPython for WebAssembly (WASM) that aims to bring the [Scientific Python stack](https://scientific-python.org/) to the browser and Node.js;
- [jupyterlite-sphinx](https://jupyterlite-sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) [extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/index.html) that brings the power of [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a WASM-based JupyterLab distribution, in Sphinx-based documentation websites;
- [jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel](https://jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a JupyterLite kernel that uses Pyodide as its backend for executing Python code in the browser;
- [Autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd/), a Python framework for forward-mode and reverse-mode automatic differentiation of Python and NumPy code; and
- the [PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling) ecosystem](https://pybamm.org/), consisting of a Python package and library for the mathematical modelling of batteries and for conducting efficient simulations and experiments.

Additionally, I occasionally help triage [PyWavelets](https://github.com/PyWavelets/pywt/), a piece of software written in Python that provides tools for wavelet transforms and related mathematical operations, commonly used in signal processing and data analysis.

Here is a list of what I am interested in and would continually like to learn more about ‚Äì which is by no means exhaustive:

- open-source software in scientific computing;
- the study of numerical methods and their applications in the physical sciences;
- cloud computing and infrastructure at scale;
- interfacing compiled and interpreted languages together;
- DevOps and site reliability engineering (SRE); and
- best practices in software engineering and testing automation.

You can usually find me lurking around on myriads of repositories and discussions related to Python packaging and developer tooling, its scientific computing ecosystem, build systems, and more ‚Äì occasionally contributing to them as well.

For the ones who seek poetic malaise, here's a quote from _Ode: Intimations of Immortality_ by William Wordsworth:

**‚ÄúWhither is fled the visionary gleam? Where is it now, the glory and the dream?‚Äù**
